# haestra journal - advanced highway project log

new project: haestra. the idea came back while i was flipping through some old printer builds. i want something like a corexy, but tighter, denser, quieter, sharp lines. think: <200mmÂ³, no spaghetti belts, no ~~~~zazzy~~~~ gantries.
no cad, mostly just sketched and set goals:
- pure 2020 frame  
- clean corexy belt layout (non-stacked preferred)  
- 2 z rods, 1 motor  
- mgn12 linear rails all axis  
- toolhead must stay slim  
- minimal printed parts  
also: keep the total BOM under **$350**, so be smart about sourcing parts. 
basically i was trying to visualize the motor placement without eating up Z height.
